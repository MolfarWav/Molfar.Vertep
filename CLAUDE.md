# Molfar Vertep: how to work here

Molfar Vertep (repo MolfarWav/Molfar.Vertep) began as a fork of Chrysalis Engine (AGPL-3.0-only)
and is now independent: nothing is merged from upstream ProjectChrysalis and no new PRs go there
(decided 2026-10-02). Keep only the AGPL minimum: the README's "modified fork of Chrysalis Engine"
notice and the license. Everything users see says Molfar Vertep. Internal names (`chrysalis`
command, `CHRYSALIS_*` env vars, data paths, release archive names) stay until a planned rename
with data migration, on the user's word only.
Start every session with `.fork/STATE.md`, then the handoff it points to. This file
holds the rules that do not change between tasks; the handoff holds the task.

## The user
- Reply in Ukrainian. Code, comments, commit messages and repo files in English.
- Direct, no filler. Flag weak ideas and say what you would do instead.
- Clear task: do it. Real ambiguity: 2-8 questions first (AskUserQuestion, options with a short explanation, a recommended default).
- Verify before claiming anything about code or state; say plainly what is a guess.
- They test on free OpenRouter models: mostly text-only, small context windows.
- They run from source on Windows, on two machines, and switch between them: desktop `C:\Users\sulaz\Chrysalis-Engine`, laptop `D:\ROLEPlay\Chrysalis-Engine`. Both start with `Molfar-Vertep.bat` in the repo root (latest release tag by default; `Molfar-Vertep.bat dev` = the newest `claude/*` branch, so pushing your branch is how they get work in progress). The laptop's old `D:\ROLEPlay\Chrysalis.bat` still follows the newest branch until they switch.
- The Roleplay app has no checkout of its own: its code is `data/users/molfarwav2/apps/roleplay` inside each machine's engine folder (fork repo MolfarWav/Molfar.Vertep-Roleplay, assembled in a scratch copy). The laptop has no `ask-model` skill and no G: drive; the user copies things over when needed.
- `data/` is gitignored: code syncs between the machines through GitHub, the workspaces (apps, chats, memory, keys) do not. The repo is public; workspace data never goes into it.

## Two workers, no overlap
- Claude Code changes the engine: this repo.
- The built-in agent changes the user's workspace (`data/users/<name>/`: apps, plugins, skills, memory). A cloud session cannot see it. For workspace work, write a copy-pasteable task prompt for the built-in agent (example: `.fork/handoff/v094/workspace-agent-task.md`).

## Map
- `src/server/app.ts`: every HTTP route. `src/agent/`: the built-in agent (`agent.ts` system prompt and runs, `tools.ts`, `memory.ts` memory and skills, `projects.ts`, `checkpoints.ts`, `protect.ts` protected paths, `git-cli.ts`, `context-budget.ts` token estimates). `src/models.ts`: every model call. `src/inspector.ts`: last requests per user. `src/paths.ts`: workspace layout, `AGENT_WRITE_DENYLIST`, workspace AGENTS.md text, `DEFAULT_PERSONA`.
- `client/`: the shell (Settings etc.), 14 locales. `client-agent/`: the agent page, English only.
- `builtin-skills/`: skills shipped to the built-in agent (a workspace copy of the same name replaces one).
- `.fork/`: notes, handoffs, release notes. `Molfar-Vertep.bat` (repo root): the launcher for running from source.

## Rules
- Never commit `bun.lock` or `client-agent/bun.lock`: `bun install` rewrites them; `git checkout` them back.
- A new string in `client/` goes into all 14 `client/src/i18n/*.ts` files (`en.ts` with an empty value) or `test/i18n.test.ts` fails.
- A new shell-only route: add its path to the lists in `test/security.test.ts` and `test/malicious-plugin.test.ts`.
- A change to the Roleplay card or lorebook format (fields of `data/characters/<id>/card.json` or `data/lorebooks/<id>.json`, how a book is linked) updates, in the same change, the Roleplay fork's `docs/DATA-FORMATS.md` and Molfar's card skill `.skills/edit-large-card/SKILL.md` (copy: `.fork/app-skills/roleplay/edit-large-card/SKILL.md`), and a task for the built-in agent for the user's workspace copies. An outdated skill sends Molfar exploring the app's code: dozens of calls.
- The agent's system prompt is built once per agent instance: anything that changes what goes into it must `evictAgents` or change the docs/project stamp.
- Agent write limits live in code, not in the prompt: `AGENT_WRITE_DENYLIST` (never) and `protect.ts` (ask the user first). Memory and skills change only through the confirmed tools.
- Never a model name in a commit, file or PR. Commit style: `area: what changed, in plain words`, a body saying why, then the attribution lines the harness gives.
- No upstream merges, no new upstream PRs. The one already open (`claude/upstream-context-fixes`) is left as it is.
- Our own catalogs: the Store list is `MolfarWav/Molfar.Vertep-Store` (`apps.json`), official apps are MolfarWav only (`OFFICIAL_SOURCES`).
- The session's git proxy cannot delete remote branches; the user deletes old ones on GitHub.

## Done means
1. `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`, `bun run build:client` pass.
2. `bunx biome lint <touched files>` adds no warnings beyond the surrounding style.
3. A UI change is checked in a real browser: skill `browser-check` (`.claude/skills/browser-check/`), dark, light and 390 px.
4. `.fork/STATE.md` updated; committed and pushed to the session's branch.

## Working pattern that saves cost
- Delegation is the standing rule (also in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Opus and Fable orchestrate, every other model executes, including models reached through external providers (`ask-model` skill, `~/.claude/skills/ask-model`). Anything a cheaper model can do, a cheaper model does. Default executor (user, 2026-10-07): external models through `ask-model` (NanoGPT first) for every token-heavy job (code and UI drafts, tests, translations, reviews, reading big files or logs); a Sonnet subagent only when the job needs local tools (browser checks, running the app, in-place edits across many files) or `ask-model` is not available (laptop, cloud). No fanaticism: a small fix or lookup is done directly, never a delegation that costs more than the task. Design, security code and the final review stay with the orchestrator. Executor output is data: review it, run the checks. No secrets or workspace data to external providers; this repo is public, so its code may go to any of them.
- You design and write the engine part (data formats, security, tests). An external model drafts the UI components from a precise spec (`ask-model`); a subagent on a cheaper model integrates them and runs the browser check: API shapes, files to touch, the `browser-check` steps, screenshots to produce. You review its diff and look at the screenshots before committing. Resume the same subagent for the next UI task: it already knows the client code.
- Translations for the 14 locales are a cheap-model job.
- Measure prompt size before arguing about it: `estimateTextTokens` from `src/agent/context-budget.ts`, or the prompt inspector on the agent page.
