# A plugin does nothing: prove each link, in order

You cannot read the engine log, but `plugin_log` shows every plugin's `host.log`/console lines and failed routes, hooks and tools since the engine started. Read it first (`plugin_log { app, errors: true }`). Do not guess and do not rewrite the plugin "to be safe". Walk the links below in order, stop at the first broken one, fix only that, then verify (step 7).

## 1. Is it where the engine looks?
- Bundled: `apps/<app>/plugins/<id>/manifest.json` + `plugin.js`. Top-level: `plugins/<id>/…`. Any other folder is never loaded.
- The manifest must parse: `jq . apps/<app>/plugins/<id>/manifest.json`.
- The user can switch a bundled plugin off in the app's plugin settings. A disabled plugin never runs. Ask when nothing else explains it.

## 2. Does the manifest allow what the code does?
| Code uses | Needs in `permissions` |
|---|---|
| `handleRoute` | `routes` |
| `TOOLS` + `handleTool`, `appTools` | `tools` |
| `host.llm.*` | `llm` |
| `host.store.*` | `store` (without it, writes are dropped) |
| `host.fs.*` | `fs` |
| `onTick` | `schedule` AND `"schedule": { "intervalMs": N }` |
| `llmRequest` | `hooks` + `llm` |
| `host.net.*` | `network` (+ optional `networkHosts`) |

- `origin: "imported"` needs the user's grant for each permission in Settings. `origin: "local"` is trusted.
- `host.fs` exists only in app-bundled plugins, scoped to that app's `data/`. A top-level plugin has no fs, even with the permission.

## 3. Is the export one the engine calls?
- The engine calls only: `handleRoute`, `handleTool`, `onTick`, `uiPanel`, `onAppUpdate`, `appTools`, `llmRequest`. Any other name (`onSchedule`, `tick`, `run`, a default export) is never called, and nothing reports it.
- Signatures are fixed. `onTick(ctx, host)`, where ctx is `{ pluginId }`. A one-argument `onTick(host)` receives ctx as "host", so `host.fs` is undefined and the tick throws. This is the most common bug.
- ESM only: `export function onTick(ctx, host) {…}`. `exports.x =` or `module.exports` exports nothing.
- Keep exports synchronous. There is no `fetch`, `setTimeout`, `require`, or npm import. Async work goes through `host.llm` / `host.net` (two-phase).
- Check quickly: `grep -nE "^export (async )?function|exports\.|module\.exports" <plugin.js>`

## 4. Scheduler facts (onTick)
- Minimum interval is 5000 ms. The first tick fires one full interval after the timer arms: with 300000 that is 5 minutes. Do not call it broken sooner.
- Timers arm only after the signed-in user's browser has made a request (they re-sync about every 10 s). After an engine restart with no Molfar Vertep tab open, nothing ticks.
- A tick never overlaps the previous tick of the same plugin.
- While testing, lower `intervalMs` to 15000. Restore the original value after.

## 5. Two-phase traps that look like "nothing happened"
- Each run has at most 3 passes, so at most 2 rounds of llm/net requests. A third round is dropped, unless the manifest's `limits.passes` raises it (skill `two-phase-llm`). Each pass has a 10 s execution limit.
- In a hook (onTick, uiPanel…), pass 2 gets as ctx whatever pass 1 returned, when that was an object. Return nothing from pass 1, or return the state you need next. Never return `{ __llmPending: true }` from onTick and then read `ctx.pluginId`.
- `host.fs.write` happens immediately, it is not deferred. Writing on pass 1 writes stale data, then writes again. Write only once the results you need are present.
- `host.llm.results[key]` is `{ text, error? }`. Empty text with an error means the model call failed: no model set, or a rate limit on a free OpenRouter model. Record the error; do not treat it as "no facts found".

## 6. Make it observable
`host.log` lines and thrown errors go to `plugin_log`. For a route, call it with `app_request` and read `plugin_log` right after. For a tick or hook, wait for it to run, then read. When the log is empty or gone (the engine restarted), add a heartbeat file you can read:

```js
function beat(host, stage, extra) {
  try {
    host.fs.write("_debug/PLUGIN_ID.json", JSON.stringify({ at: new Date().toISOString(), stage, ...(extra || {}) }, null, 2));
  } catch (e) {
    host.log("heartbeat failed: " + e);
  }
}
```

- Call `beat` on entry, after each phase, and in a `catch` around the whole body with `String(e)`. An uncaught throw reaches only the log.
- Wait one interval, then read `apps/<app>/data/_debug/PLUGIN_ID.json`. The `_` prefix keeps it out of the UI.
- No file means the export never ran: go back to steps 1–4. A file shows the stage where it stopped.
- If the file is still missing, read `plugin_log { plugin: "<id>" }`: the line `onTick failed: …` is the thrown error.

## 7. Done means verified
- The heartbeat or `plugin_log` shows the final stage on a real tick or request (`app_request` for a route).
- The expected output file exists and its content is fresh.
- The heartbeat and the test interval are removed. The heartbeat writes a tracked file on every tick, so leaving it in floods git history.
- The fix is committed with the git tool.
- If the cause was not obvious, propose it for the app's memory with `memory_propose` (scope `app:<id>`).
