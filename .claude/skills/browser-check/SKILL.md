name: browser-check
description: Use to check a Chrysalis change in a real browser (agent page or shell), with real agent runs on a fake model and no API keys. Starts a throwaway engine, a mock OpenAI-compatible model, an account and a connection, then gives Playwright helpers. Use before calling any UI change done, and give the same recipe to a subagent that builds UI.

# Check a change in a real browser

Without this, every session rebuilds the same setup by hand and trips on the
same things: the engine runs a model from the environment instead of the mock,
a pipe into `tail` hangs on a background process, `pkill` kills your own shell.

## 1. Start
```bash
W=<your scratchpad>/bc          # any folder; it is wiped
bun run build:client            # after UI edits: the engine serves the built client
.claude/skills/browser-check/start.sh $W        # optional: ENGINE_PORT MOCK_PORT (8796 8797)
```
It prints the URL, the account (`molfar` / `test1234`) and the model ref, and
writes `$W/env`:
- `ENGINE_URL`, `ENGINE_PID`, `MOCK_PID`, `MOCK_URL`
- `MODEL_REF`: the mock's model ref
- `DATA`: the user's workspace, for seeding files and checking writes
- `JAR`: the cookie jar, for curl calls

## 2. Seed what the test needs (optional)
- An app: `mkdir -p $DATA/apps/roleplay && echo '{"name":"Roleplay","version":"1","kind":"web","origin":"local"}' > $DATA/apps/roleplay/manifest.json`
- A free project: `curl -b $JAR -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "origin: $ENGINE_URL" -X POST $ENGINE_URL/v1/projects -d '{"title":"Ideas"}'`
- A finished chat without running the model: write `$DATA/agent/sessions/<id>.jsonl`. The first line is `{"type":"start","at":<ms>,"user":"hi"}`, then one `{"type":"run",…}` line per run. Copy the shape from `SessionRunRecord` in `src/agent/agent.ts`.

## 3. Drive it
Write the script in `$W` (`playwright-core` and `pw.mjs` are there):
```js
import { open, send, shot, turns, close, DATA } from "./pw.mjs"
const page = await open()                     // agent page, dark, 1280x800, logged in, mock model picked
await send(page, "what is AGENTS.md?")        // waits for the run to settle
await shot(page, "agent")                     // $W/agent.png; warns when the page scrolls sideways
await turns([{ tool: "write_file", args: { path: "apps/roleplay/data/x.json", content: "{}" } }, { text: "Done." }])
await send(page, "make x")                    // the mock now plays the new script
const phone = await open({ width: 390, theme: "light" })   // also: path "/" (shell), lang "ru"
await shot(phone, "phone")
await close()
```
Run it with `cd $W && bun t.mjs`.
- The mock answers each request with the next turn of its script, cycling. A turn is `{text}` or `{tool, args}`. The default script reads AGENTS.md, then answers.
- An `ask_user` turn opens the card: click it in the page.
- Native `confirm()` dialogs: `page.on("dialog", (d) => d.accept())`.
- Controlled checkboxes: `.click()` and wait, not `.check()`.

## 4. Stop
`.claude/skills/browser-check/stop.sh $W` stops the engine and the mock by PID. Never `pkill -f src/index.ts`: it matches your own shell.

## Traps
- `/v1/models` without `?all=1` lists only shown models; start.sh writes `models-shown.json` so the mock is the only one.
- The agent page theme comes from `localStorage["chrysalis-theme"]`, not the OS.
- The browser: the cloud image's /opt/pw-browsers, else an installed Chrome or Edge (Windows, macOS, Linux); `CHROME_PATH` overrides.
- Screens prove layout. A behavior claim needs the file on disk (`$DATA/...`) or an API read too.
- A subagent building UI gets this file's path and runs the same steps; ask it for screenshot paths and look at them yourself.
