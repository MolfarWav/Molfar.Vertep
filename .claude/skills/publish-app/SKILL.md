name: publish-app
description: Use when the user asks to publish an app's workspace changes (made by Molfar or by hand) as the app's default for everyone, for example "опублікуй зміни Ролплею", "publish the Roleplay changes", "зроби це дефолтом". Takes the app's code diff against the installed baseline, carries the chosen files into a clone of the app's repository, then review, tests, version, CHANGELOG and push on the user's word.

# Publish an app's workspace changes

Molfar changes app code in the user's workspace (`data/users/<name>/apps/<id>`).
This turns those changes into a release of the app's own repository (Roleplay:
`MolfarWav/Molfar.Vertep-Roleplay`). Works only on the machine that holds the
workspace (the desktop: `C:\Users\sulaz\Chrysalis-Engine\data`); a cloud
session cannot see it.

## 1. See what changed
```bash
bun scripts/publish-app.ts list --app roleplay --data C:/Users/sulaz/Chrysalis-Engine/data
bun scripts/publish-app.ts diff --app roleplay --data <same> src/foo.tsx plugins/bar/plugin.js
```
`list` compares the app's code with the baseline the engine kept from the last
install or update. It never shows `data/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`,
`manifest.json` or `.memory/`. Each file may carry warnings: lockfile, secret,
absolute local path, the user's name, conflict markers, large file, app skill.
Below the files it lists the workspace's commits to the app's code since that
update: Molfar describes each change there (built-in skill
`publishable-changes`), and `local: ` marks one the user keeps to themselves.
In a worktree, pass `--data` (worktrees have no `data/`). `--user` when more
than one user has the app.

If the workspace version is older than the repository's newest release, the
app has an update pending: ask the user to take it first (Updates panel), or
`apply` merges and conflicts get likelier.

## 2. Choose with the user
Read every diff. Sort the files into: publish, leave local (personal tweaks,
experiments, old plugins like `plugins/archivarius` that a release replaced,
anything whose commit starts with `local: `), unsure.
Ask the user (AskUserQuestion) with that proposal before writing anything.
A file with a secret or personal data is never published as it is: fix the
code in the clone (move the value to `data/` or settings) or leave it.

## 3. Carry the files into a clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MolfarWav/Molfar.Vertep-Roleplay <scratchpad>/rp
bun scripts/publish-app.ts apply --app roleplay --data <same> --into <scratchpad>/rp <files...>
```
For each file: `written` (repository still had the baseline), `already there`,
`deleted`, `merged with repository changes` (the repository moved since the
baseline), or `CONFLICT` (exit code 2: resolve the markers by hand). Lockfiles
are never copied: run `bun install` in the clone when `package.json` changed,
then commit the new lockfile.

## 4. Make it a release
In the clone:
- Review the diff as your own code: style of the app, its `AGENTS.md`, no
  personal data, defaults in code, English code and comments, i18n strings in
  both `en` and `uk` where the app has them.
- `bun install`, `bunx tsc --noEmit -p .` (Roleplay: the one known error at
  `src/components/extensions/plugin-panel.tsx:88` is old), `bun test`.
- A UI change: check it in a browser (skill `browser-check`; on Windows copy
  the clone into a throwaway engine's workspace with its plugin grants and
  drive the local Chrome with `playwright-core`), dark, light and 390 px.
- Version in `manifest.json`: patch for fixes, minor for features. The new
  version's `CHANGELOG.md` section is written from the published commits,
  user-facing, in the CHANGELOG's own style. Never copy the workspace's
  `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Roleplay's guide: set `APP_VERSION` in `src/lib/guide-tips.ts` to the new
  version (its test compares it with the manifest). A published feature the
  user decides with gets a tip there with `since` = the new version, so What's
  new shows it once; tips Molfar added without `since` get it now if they are
  new. The app's AGENTS.md, "The in-app guide", has the format.
- Commit `Roleplay X.Y.Z: what changed, in plain words`, body saying why and
  that it came from the user's workspace, then the attribution lines.

## 5. Push only on the user's word
Pushing the repository's `main` ships the version to every install through the
Updates panel. Show the user the version, the file list and the CHANGELOG
lines, wait for a clear yes, then `git push origin main`.

After the push the user's own workspace takes the update like everyone else;
the three-way merge sees the same change on both sides and keeps it. Files
left local stay local. Record the release in `.fork/STATE.md`.
