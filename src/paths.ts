const USER_AGENTS_MD_BODY = `# Molfar Vertep workspace

Everything here is files you can edit like code — this user's whole Molfar Vertep world. The engine hot-reloads as you save.

## Git (who commits what)
- The repo is preconfigured (identity, reflog): an agent running on the host uses plain \`git add/commit/log/reflog\`; the built-in agent's browser sandbox has no git binary, so it commits through its \`git\` tool (status, diff, log, commit, restore, revert…) on this same repo.
- Writes made through app HTTP routes auto-commit with the route in the message.
- Your own direct edits stay pending until you commit them (\`git add -A && git commit\`); if an app request fires first, the engine commits them under an honest \`out-of-band: <files>\` label — nothing is lost, check \`git log\`.

## Layout
- \`apps/<id>/\` — installed apps: a React + tailwind web project with vite conventions (\`index.html\`, \`src/\`, \`package.json\`; built in the browser, \`vite.config.*\` is not run) + \`plugins/<id>/\` (backend ES modules) + \`data/\` (whatever the app stores). \`node_modules/\`/\`dist/\` are derived (outside git). Dependencies install and uninstall engine-side with lifecycle scripts disabled (the built-in agent's \`app_deps\` tool); the sandbox itself has no node or npm.
- An app is free to be anything: a chat studio, a visual novel, a game, a tool. Each carries its own \`AGENTS.md\` and \`data/README.md\` (its field-shape map) — read those before editing that app.
- \`plugins/<id>/\` — top-level always-on plugins (same format as app plugins).
- \`projects/<name>/\` — the user's free projects (plugins, research, ideas), shown on the agent page beside the apps: \`PROJECT.md\` (instructions for chats in that project), \`project.json\` (title, default model), \`files/\` (reference uploads). An app's own project settings and uploads sit in \`apps/<id>/.project/\`. Uploads (\`files/\`) are outside git and the user's: read them, never write them.
- \`providers.json\` — custom model endpoints. \`settings.json\` — activeApp etc. (the Settings UI owns it; agents do not read or edit it).
- \`commands/\` — reusable prompts, one markdown file each. \`review.md\` is \`/review\` in the composer, and the first line is its description. Yours; the engine never writes here.
- \`notes/\` — plans, specs and reference material, yours to create and keep. The engine never writes here and never deletes anything in it. Every file is listed for the agent by name and first line, so write one per topic with a first line that says what it covers, and read the relevant note before starting work in that area.
- \`persona.md\` — standing instructions that apply to EVERY request. Always in the agent's context (Settings > the agent instructions box writes it). Keep it short; put anything task-shaped in \`notes/\` instead.
- In app \`data/\` trees, files starting with \`_\` are AI-only templates (never shown in the UI): copy \`_example.json\` to a real name to create the entity with the right shape.
- NOT here (never reachable): credentials, \`mcp.json\`, \`connections.json\` and \`speech.json\` — all live outside the workspace in the engine's credentials dir. MCP servers, model connections and speech endpoints are the user's to configure in Settings; an MCP entry runs a command on the host or opens unrestricted egress, so nothing in this workspace can author one.

## Driving the engine (optional — files alone cover most work)
The local engine also exposes HTTP:
- API base: \`<the address Molfar Vertep prints at start>/v1\`, by default \`http://127.0.0.1:8788/v1\` (auth: the user's bearer token / session). The port is set in the engine's config.yaml, which lives outside this workspace.

## Where a change goes
Pick the lightest place that can carry the change. All three are supported and all three survive an app update — an update is a three-way merge against the version the app was installed from, so your edits are kept and only an edit that overlaps the same lines as the update conflicts (and then nothing is written until the user picks how to settle it). App \`data/\` is never part of an update at all.
1. \`apps/<id>/data/\` — content, settings, entities. No rebuild, open clients pick it up in about a second, and it can never conflict with an update. Most requests end here.
2. \`apps/<id>/plugins/<your-id>/\` — backend behavior: routes, tools, scheduled work. Prefer a NEW plugin folder of your own over editing one that shipped with the app: a file only you added has no upstream version to disagree with, so it can never conflict.
3. \`apps/<id>/src/\` — the UI. Editing it is normal and expected; it is how the app changes shape. It rebuilds in the user's browser (call app_check afterwards) and puts that file into the merge path on the next update.
Read the app's own AGENTS.md before deciding: it says which of its behavior is already data-driven, and reaching for \`src/\` for something a data file already controls is the one wrong answer here.

## Rules
- Never touch anything outside this workspace: the engine's credentials store, other users' directories, and the Molfar Vertep engine's own install (source, deps, git repo) are off-limits — the user updates the engine themselves.
- Prefer relative paths from the workspace root; this directory is your whole world.
- Plugin files are ES modules (export function handleRoute(req, host) {…}) — never CommonJS.
- After editing plugins/manifests, the engine hot-reloads; if unsure, ask the user to refresh.

- Take a checkpoint before a risky change. When a build keeps failing, offer to restore one instead of piling on fixes.
- Before you say "done", verify it (skill finish-change) and say what you could not check.

- Make the first line say what the file covers. That line is what your agent
  reads in the list, and it is how it decides which file to open.
